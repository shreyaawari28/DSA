This repository contains a Java solution for the **LeetCode problem: Max Consecutive Ones**.

The solution finds the maximum number of consecutive `1`s present in a binary array using a single-pass approach.

---

## 📌 Problem Overview

Given a binary array, the task is to determine the **maximum number of consecutive `1`s** in the array.

This problem is commonly used to test:
- Array traversal
- Counter-based logic
- Efficient single-pass solutions

---

## 🧪 Code Functionality

- Iterates through the array once  
- Increments a counter when `1` is encountered  
- Resets the counter when `0` is encountered  
- Tracks the maximum consecutive count of `1`s  
- Returns the maximum value found  

---

## 🧠 Concepts Covered

- Arrays  
- Linear traversal  
- Counter-based logic  
- Conditional statements  
- Single-pass optimization  

---
