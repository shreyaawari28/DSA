# 136. Single Number – Java Solution

This repository contains a Java solution for the **LeetCode problem: Single Number**.

The solution finds the element that appears **only once** in an array where every other element appears **exactly twice**.

---

## 📌 Problem Overview

Given a non-empty integer array, every element appears twice except for one element.  
The task is to identify and return that **unique element**.

This problem is commonly used to evaluate:
- Array traversal skills
- Logical reasoning
- Understanding of frequency-based problems

---

## 🧪 Code Functionality

- Iterates through each element of the array  
- Compares the current element with all other elements  
- Counts the number of occurrences  
- Identifies the element that appears only once  
- Returns the unique element  

---

## 🧠 Concepts Covered

- Arrays  
- Nested loops  
- Frequency counting  
- Conditional logic  
- Brute-force search approach  

---

## ⏱️ Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity:** `O(n²)`  
- **Space Complexity:** `O(1)`
