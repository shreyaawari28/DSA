# 977. Squares of a Sorted Array – Java Solution

This repository contains a Java solution for the **LeetCode problem: Squares of a Sorted Array**.

The solution computes the square of each element in the array and then sorts the resulting values in non-decreasing order.

---

## 📌 Problem Overview

Given an integer array sorted in non-decreasing order, the task is to return a new array containing the **squares of each number**, also sorted in non-decreasing order.

This problem is commonly used to test:
- Array manipulation
- Understanding of sorting logic
- Trade-offs between brute-force and optimized approaches

---

## 🧪 Code Functionality

- Iterates through the array and squares each element  
- Sorts the squared values using a nested loop comparison  
- Modifies the array in place  
- Returns the sorted array of squared values  

---

## 🧠 Concepts Covered

- Arrays  
- Squaring elements  
- Nested loops  
- In-place sorting  
- Brute-force sorting approach  

---

## ⏱️ Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity:** `O(n²)`  
- **Space Complexity:** `O(1)` (in-place)

## ⚠️ Notes

- The solution is correct but not optimal  
- Time complexity does not meet the best possible solution  
- Can be optimized using a two-pointer approach for `O(n)` time  
- Suitable for understanding brute-force logic before optimization
